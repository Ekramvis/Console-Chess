Console Chess
=============

This was a 2-day project I completed in week 2 of App Academy. This chess game is played completely within the console. 

As one of my first projects in Ruby, the learning objective was to practice to object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and inheritence.

To play the game:

1. After cloning the repository and navigating to the directory, open up pry or irb. 
2. Load the "chess.rb" file. This will automatically launch a 2-player game (white goes first)
3. Use the alegbraic notation system to make moves.
